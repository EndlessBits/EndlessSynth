### Endless Synth

Endless Synth is a 1-bit synthesizer which generates sine wave.
It has sliders to control volume, diffuse step and history duration.
Also from keys user can switch octaves and sample rate.

The style of playing is like guitar - you choose "notes" by the left hand and hit "strings" by the right hand.
This style fits well for live performance of arpeggios found in 8-bit games music.
