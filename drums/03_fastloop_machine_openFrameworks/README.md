# Drum machine with half-speed recording

This is experimental drum machine written for PC/Mac on openFrameworks.

Recording goes with slow time and playing two times faster.

Keys:
1,2,3,4 - play kick, snare, snare2, hat.
Esc - exit

It's appears that different times not playful, but good point to think further on it...
