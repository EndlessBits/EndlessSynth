# Drum machine with semi-automatic repeater

This is experimental drum machine written for PC/Mac on Processing.

Keys:
1,q,a,z - kick, 
2,w,s,x - snare, 
3,e,d,c - snare2, 
4,,r,f,v - hat.
Esc - exit

Pressing keys repeats the drum with given number of times and delay.

The idea was to play quick breaks easily.
But it's not happen :)
